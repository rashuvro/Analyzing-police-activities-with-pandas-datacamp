Description
In this proejct, I explored the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. During the course, I practiced cleaning messy data, creating visualizations, combining and reshaping datasets, and manipulating time series data. 

Project includes:

- Preparing the data for analysis
- Exploring the relationship between gender and policing
- Visual exploratory data analysis
- Analyzing the effect of weather on policing
